⏱️ Circuit Timing Analysis using XGBoost

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the logic depth of circuits using XGBoost, an efficient machine learning model. The trained model is saved as optimizing_timing_model.pkl and can be used to analyze circuit performance based on given features.

🛠 Features

Predicts logic depth of circuits based on input parameters.

Uses XGBoost for high-performance learning.

Evaluates model performance with MAE, MSE, and R² score.

Saves and loads optimized models efficiently.

Supports real-time predictions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset login_circuit_dataset.csv consists of the following columns:

Component: Circuit component type.

Fan_In: Number of inputs to a gate.

Fan_Out: Number of outputs from a gate.

Num_Gates: Total number of gates in the circuit.

Path_Length: Length of the critical path in the circuit.

Logic_Depth: Target variable for prediction.

🚀 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circuit-timing-analysis.git
cd circuit-timing-analysis

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the dataset login_circuit_dataset.csv is in the project directory.

🏗 Model Training & Optimization

Run the following command to train and optimize the model:

python main.py

The model will be saved as optimizing_timing_model.pkl after optimization.

📊 Model Evaluation

After training, the model performance is evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures squared error penalty.

R² Score: Indicates how well predictions match actual values.

📌 Usage

Load and Predict with the Optimized Model

import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
with open("optimizing_timing_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Sample input features: [Fan_In, Fan_Out, Num_Gates, Path_Length]
circuit_features = np.array([[3, 5, 10, 15]])

# Make prediction
predicted_logic_depth = model.predict(circuit_features)
print(f"Predicted Logic Depth: {predicted_logic_depth[0]}")

🖼️ Visualization

The script generates Prediction vs. Actual Plot to visualize model accuracy.
Ensure matplotlib is installed to display the plot.
